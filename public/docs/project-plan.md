## Risk Management

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Database connection issues | Medium | High | Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | High | Follow security best practices, use input validation and authentication |
| Server downtime | Low | Medium | Configure monitoring and automatic restart mechanisms |
| Feature creep | Medium | Medium | Stick to the defined requirements, schedule additional features for future releases |
| Time constraints | High | High | Prioritize core features, use timeboxing to ensure completion of key functionality |

## Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests: Test individual components and functions
- Integration Tests: Test API endpoints and database operations
- User Acceptance Testing: Manual testing of the complete application flow
- Security Testing: Check for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)

## Quality Assurance Checkpoints

- Code follows consistent formatting and naming conventions
- All critical functions have proper error handling
- User inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- Authentication and authorization are properly implemented
- Application is responsive and works on different devices
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive

## Project Dependencies

- Node.js environment for development and production
- MongoDB installation for data storage
- Internet access for package installation and deployment
- DNS configuration access for domain setup

## Post-Implementation Review

A post-implementation review will be conducted to evaluate:
- Whether all requirements were met
- The quality of the delivered application
- Lessons learned from the project
- Recommendations for future improvements
